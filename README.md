Unity webgl game activity module on moodle that lets student play games related to class topics on moodle and submit the results.

- Create a game just like you would create an assignment by uploading the game and filling the necessarry fields.
- The students will be able play the game on the browser and the game's result can be submitted to the system, either automatically(via moodle tasks) or manually. (The game needs to be compatible meaning it either needs to export the result in the base game directory or send a request to the server with the result)
- Students can view their score and pass or fail situation(in the course page or on the game page), and the scoreboard for a particular game(on the game page).
- Admins can view, update and delete students results for every game uploaded to different courses.
